# Games 
I'd like to make a simple game playing agent. Thus far, I've
unfortunately chosen games I either don't understand well, or are 
intrinsically quite difficult to do this with, and therefore
have not had much success. (*Poker*, *Chess*, *Soduku,...*)

I'm leaving skeleton programs of those past attempts here, but 
now I'm going to try and return to basics and start with the most
simple games I can think of!
